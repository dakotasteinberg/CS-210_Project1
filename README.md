Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project takes the current time and adds hours, minutes, and/or seconds to both the 12 and 24 hour versions.

What did you do particularly well?
I learned how to make my functions work correctly and without error.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could further enhance my code by using classes or using more granular functions.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Getting the current time was the most challenging. There are a multitude of ways you can go about doing it and I ultimately found the one I used at the 
recommendation of a tutor.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I understand programming as a whole much better after this project. I feel comfortable with concepts I had trouble understanding before such as functions, objects, and classes.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I used comments where necessary and kept the code in main to a minimum by having all of my functions in the .h file.
